// Cross Origin Policy meant no Google pop ups in Chrome
// So, I had to use Firefox to test the Google Sign In

// Ran into issues that I couldn't decipher, had to familiarize myself with git revert

// Video did not show how to use JWT_SECRET, had to look it up

// Learned a lot about exporting and importing, when to use curly braces and when not to (ie default uses no curly braces)

//TODO Google profile picture not showing up, currentUser.avatar on redux tab is showing default instead of the google profile picture

//I think this was solved by deleting the existing user and resigning in with Google

//After redownloading the project, iCloud Drive renamed my project by adding a 2 to the end of the folder name deep in the git files, preventing me from pushing changes to the original project

// Moved entire repo to another section of hard drive that was not conflicting with iCloud Drive

// Width of inputs are not the same size as video, extremely wide..using w-24 as tmp fix but not ideal

// FIGURED OUT IT WAS BECAUSE OF MY BROWSER!! Adjusted my firefox view settings but not for Chrome so it looks much better in Chrome
